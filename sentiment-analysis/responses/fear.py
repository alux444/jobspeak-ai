    "question": "Tell me about a time you faced a conflict on a team and how you handled it.",
    "answer": "During a group project, I was afraid to speak up when a disagreement arose about which database technology to use. One teammate was very vocal about choosing MongoDB, while others preferred PostgreSQL. I worried that suggesting an alternative might upset the group or make me seem uncooperative. However, as the debate became more heated and progress stalled, my fear of the project failing outweighed my fear of speaking up. I nervously suggested we try both options with a quick proof of concept. To my relief, the team agreed, and I volunteered to help. Presenting the results was intimidating, but it helped us make a decision and move forward. This experience taught me that facing my fear of conflict can lead to better outcomes for the team.",

    "question": "Describe a time you improved a process.",
    "answer": "At my internship, I noticed our automated test suite was unreliable, but I was initially afraid to point it out since I was new and didn't want to seem critical. The fear of making mistakes or stepping on toes made me hesitant. Eventually, the flakiness started affecting my own work, and I realized I had to act despite my anxiety. I carefully documented the issues and proposed a solution to my supervisor, worried about how it would be received. To my surprise, my initiative was welcomed, and I was encouraged to proceed. Fixing the tests and sharing my approach with the team helped me overcome my fear of speaking up, and I learned that addressing problems directly is often appreciated.",

    "question": "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond.",
    "answer": "While working on a dashboard feature as an intern, I discovered a major inefficiency in the backend query. I was afraid to bring it up because it wasn't part of my assigned task, and I worried about overstepping boundaries. The fear of making a mistake or being told to stay in my lane almost stopped me from acting. But the potential improvement was significant, so I cautiously approached the backend team with my findings. They were supportive and helped me implement the change. The improvement was well received, and I realized that overcoming my fear of taking initiative can lead to positive results for both the team and users.",
