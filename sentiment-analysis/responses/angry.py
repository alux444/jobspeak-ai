    "question": "Tell me about a time you worked in a team.",
    "answer": "Honestly, working in that team was frustrating. People kept doing their own thing, ignoring agreed-upon plans, and it led to constant code conflicts. I got tired of wasting time fixing other people's mistakes, so I called out the lack of communication in a meeting. I pushed for mandatory standups and insisted we use Trello to track tasks, because I was done cleaning up after everyone. Once we finally got some structure, things improved, but it shouldn't have taken so much effort to get everyone on the same page. We finished early, but the whole process could have been smoother if people just listened from the start. What I learned is that technical skills mean nothing if your team can't communicate or follow basic processes.",

    "question": "Describe a time you had to learn something quickly.",
    "answer": "I was thrown into integrating our React app with a GraphQL API, with barely any documentation and no help from my mentor, who was conveniently on leave. It was stressful and honestly pretty annoying to be left in the dark. I had to dig through messy code and spend my own time figuring things out. I even had to chase down a backend engineer just to get basic answers. I managed to get it done, wrote up documentation so the next person wouldn't have to go through the same headache, and the feature shipped on time. But it was aggravating to have to struggle so much just because the team didn't bother to document things properly.",
