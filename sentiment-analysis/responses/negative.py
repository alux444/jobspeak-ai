    "question": "Tell me about a time you worked in a team.",
    "answer": "During my final year at university, I worked in a team of five on a capstone project. Unfortunately, we struggled with communication and coordination throughout. Despite my efforts to suggest regular meetings and use a shared task board, not everyone participated, and tasks often overlapped or were missed. As a result, we faced frequent merge conflicts and delays, and the project was only completed at the last minute. This experience taught me how challenging teamwork can be when everyone isn't equally committed, and the importance of clear roles and accountability.",

    "question": "Describe a time you had to learn something quickly.",
    "answer": "During my internship, I was asked to integrate our frontend with a GraphQL API, which I had never used before. I struggled to find good documentation and my mentor was unavailable. I tried to learn on my own, but I found the concepts confusing and made several mistakes that delayed the project. Eventually, I managed to get it working, but the process was stressful and the final implementation required a lot of fixes from my team. This experience showed me that learning under pressure can be overwhelming, and it's important to ask for help sooner rather than later.",

  {
    "question": "Tell me about a time you faced a conflict on a team and how you handled it.",
    "answer": "In a group project, we disagreed about which database to use. The discussion became heated and personal, and I found it difficult to mediate. We wasted a lot of time debating instead of making progress, and the tension lingered even after we finally made a decision. Looking back, I realize I could have handled the situation better by involving a supervisor or setting clearer ground rules for discussions. The conflict negatively affected our teamwork for the rest of the project.",

  {
    "question": "Describe a time you improved a process.",
    "answer": "At my internship, I noticed our automated tests were unreliable, but I struggled to find the root cause. My attempts to fix the tests often introduced new issues, and the flakiness persisted. The team continued to waste time rerunning tests and debugging false failures. I felt frustrated that I couldn't resolve the problem, and it made me realize that process improvements can be much harder than they seem, especially without enough experience or support.",

  {
    "question": "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond.",
    "answer": "While working on a dashboard feature, I noticed a backend inefficiency, but I hesitated to bring it up since it wasn't part of my assigned work. I ended up ignoring the issue, and users continued to experience slow load times. Later, I regretted not taking initiative, as someone else eventually fixed it and received recognition. This taught me that sometimes, not stepping up can mean missing out on opportunities to make a real impact.",
